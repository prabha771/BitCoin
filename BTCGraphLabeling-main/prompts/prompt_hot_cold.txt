Services and businesses use a combination of both hot and cold wallets to balance security and convenience.
A hot wallet might be used for day-to-day transactions and to hold a smaller amount of cryptocurrency needed for regular activities.
The majority of funds, especially larger amounts that are meant for long-term holding, are stored in a cold wallet to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.
The objective is to identify hot and cold wallets / addresses and the corresponding service. Analyze the post and title to deduce the entity or website of the service.
$btc_address_i is an alias for address number i, and $btc_txid_i is an alias for transaction number i.
In the response, avoid summarizing the post, maintain brevity, and use the format:
"""
Reasoning: <insert your reasoning here>
Addresses: <insert list of tuples (address alias of the form ''$btc_tx_id_i', entity)>
